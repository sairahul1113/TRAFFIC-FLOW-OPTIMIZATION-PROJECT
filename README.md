Running the Program

Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-flow-optimization.git
cd traffic-flow-optimization

Step 2: Install Required Libraries

If you havenâ€™t installed the libraries yet, run:

pip install numpy tensorflow

Step 3: Run the Program

Execute the Python script to see the output:

python traffic_optimization.py

Step 4: Customize the Input

To test with different traffic data, modify the test_input variable in the script:

test_input = np.array([[15, 25, 5, 10]])  # Replace with your own values

After editing, save the script and run it again.

Step 5: Understand the Output

The program will print the direction that should get the green signal based on the current traffic density. It will also show the probability distribution among all four directions.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors related to library installation, make sure you have installed the latest version of Python and used the correct pip version (pip or pip3).
