<h1>Traffic Flow Optimization<h1/> 

#### Introduction
This project leverages a neural network model to optimize traffic light management based on vehicle counts from four directions: North, East, South, and West. The goal is to dynamically determine which direction should receive the green signal to minimize congestion.
#### Prerequisites
To run this traffic flow optimization program, you need the following:
```html
Python (version 3.7 or higher)
```
#### Libraries:
•[	NumPy](http://github.com/NumPy "	NumPy")
•[	TensorFlow](http://www.tensorflow.org/ "	TensorFlow")
#### Library Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
```html
pip install numpy
pip intalll tensorflow
```

#### Setting Up a Virtual Environment
It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies without affecting your global Python installation.

##### Step 1: Install venv (if not already installed)
For most Python distributions, venv comes pre-installed. To check, run:
```html
python3 -m venv --help  # or python -m venv --help

```
If you encounter errors, make sure to install Python with the "Add to PATH" option enabled.
##### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory:
```html
cd traffic-flow-optimization

```
#### Create the virtual environment:
```html
python3 -m venv env  # or python -m venv env

```
This will create a folder named env containing the virtual environment files.




##### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
###### On Windows:
```html
.\env\Scripts\activate
```
###### On macOS/Linux:On macOS/Linux:
```html
source env/bin/activate
```
Once activated, you will see the environment name in your terminal prompt, e.g., (env).

##### Step 4: Install Dependencies Inside the venvStep 4: Install Dependencies Inside the venv
After activating the venv, install the required libraries:
pip install numpy tensorflow
This ensures that the packages are installed only within your virtual environment.

##### Step 5: Run the ProgramStep 5: Run the Program
Now you can execute the script:
```html
python traffic_optimization.py
```
#### Deactivating the Virtual EnvironmentDeactivating the Virtual Environment
When you’re done, deactivate the venv by running:
###### deactivate
Removing the Virtual Environment
If you no longer need it, simply delete the env folder:
```html
rm -rf env  # On macOS/Linux
rmdir /S /Q env  # On Windows
```

#### Running the ProgramRunning the Program
##### Step 1: Clone the RepositoryStep 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-flow-optimization.git
```html
cd traffic-flow-optimization
```
##### Step 2: Install Required LibrariesStep 2: Install Required Libraries
If you haven’t installed the libraries yet, run:

```html
pip install numpy tensorflow
```

##### Step 3: Run the ProgramStep 3: Run the Program
Execute the Python script to see the output:

```html
python traffic_optimization.py
```
##### Step 4: Customize the InputStep 4: Customize the Input
To test with different traffic data, modify the test_input variable in the script:

test_input = np.array([[15, 25, 5, 10]])# Replace with your own values

After editing, save the script and run it again.After editing, save the script and run it again.
##### Step 5: Understand the Output
The program will print the direction that should get the green signal based on the current traffic density. It will also show the probability distribution among all four directions.


##### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any errors related to library installation, make sure you have installed the latest version of Python and used the correct pip version (pip or pip3).
